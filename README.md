# Stylish Themes

My collection of stylish themes. From time to time I find myself using a website for extended periods of time. When some sites use a light theme it is extremely painful for my eyes and very distracting. If a decent working dark theme doesnt already exist on userstyles, I'll create one and share it with the community.
